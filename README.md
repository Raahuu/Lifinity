Lifinity : A Complete Health Monitoring System is a website where every user will be given a unique QR-Code Card for faster access Login in the hospital. It has a centralized data base. Every registered hospital can access the userâ€™s data base. Every user can check his/her previous treatment history, lab reports, medicine history etc. We also implement a spot accident reporting by fetching the Geo-Location of accident located area and user can upload a photo of the incident. It will be reported to the nearest hospital from the incident location. We would also implement a SMS alert about the Vaccination period of the babies to the registered Mobiles. We also implement all other hospital related items like pharmacy, Blood Bank etc. There is even an Admin panel to oversee the site usage.
